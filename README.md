# Multi-Dataset Image Classification with TensorFlow: MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10

This repository demonstrates a deep learning implementation using TensorFlow to classify images from three popular datasets: MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10. The code includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing for MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10.
- A convolutional neural network (CNN) model architecture specifically designed for image classification tasks.
- Training and evaluation of the model on each dataset, with metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Features:
- Data normalization and one-hot encoding of labels.
- CNN architecture with convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers.
- Model training and evaluation with detailed metrics for performance assessment.

Run the code to see the model's performance on each dataset and explore the detailed evaluation metrics.
